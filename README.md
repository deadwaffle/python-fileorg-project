# python-fileorg-project
A program that will organize the files you dump. 


Specify the directory you want it to edit. I recommend creating a DUMP folder and let it organize there. To specify the path, go to line 91. *If you're on windows, ensure the \'s are facing the other way. ex: C:\Users\User1\Downloads changed to C:/Users/User1/Downloads
