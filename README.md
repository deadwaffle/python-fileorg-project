# python-fileorg-project
A program that will organize the files you dump. 

Original code: https://github.com/sahankj2000/python_file_organizer 

By default, it will reorganize the files in the directory that the code file is in. To prevent this, specify the directory you want it to edit. I recommend creating a DUMP folder and let it organize there. To specify the path, go to line 91. *If you're on windows, ensure the \'s are facing the other way. ex: C:\Users\User1\Downloads changed to C:/Users/User1/Downloads
